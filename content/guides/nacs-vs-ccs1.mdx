# NACS vs CCS1: The Complete Guide to EV Charging Connectors

If you're shopping for an electric vehicle in late 2025, you've probably encountered confusing acronyms like NACS, CCS1, and heard that "everyone's switching to Tesla's connector." This guide explains what's happening, what it means for you, and how to navigate the transition.

## The Big Picture: What's Changing?

**The short version:** The North American EV charging landscape is consolidating around Tesla's NACS connector as the new standard. By 2026-2027, nearly every new EV will have native NACS ports.

**What this means for you:**
- **Buying a 2024-2025 EV?** You'll get CCS1, but manufacturers are providing NACS adapters for Supercharger access
- **Buying a 2026+ EV?** You'll likely get native NACS and can charge anywhere
- **Already own an EV?** Check if your manufacturer offers adapters (most do)

## Understanding the Connectors

### NACS (North American Charging Standard)

**Formerly known as:** "Tesla connector"
**Developed by:** Tesla
**Made standard:** 2024

**What it looks like:**
Small, lightweight, elegant connector that handles both AC and DC charging through the same port.

**Key Specs:**
- **Power Range:** Up to 250 kW (current), 1 MW capable (future Semi trucks)
- **Voltage:** AC (Level 1/2) and DC fast charging in single connector
- **Networks:** Tesla Supercharger (50,000+ connectors globally), plus all CCS networks with adapter

**Who uses it (native):**
- **2024+:** Tesla (all models)
- **2025+:** Rivian, Ford, GM (new models)
- **2026+:** Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, Honda, Subaru, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Polestar, and others

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Smaller and lighter than CCS1 (easier to handle)
- ✅ More reliable connection (fewer moving parts)
- ✅ Access to massive Supercharger network
- ✅ Single connector for all charging speeds
- ✅ Better cold-weather performance

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Relatively new standard (less established infrastructure outside Tesla)
- ❌ Transition period confusion (2024-2026)

### CCS1 (Combined Charging System Type 1)

**Also called:** CCS Combo 1, SAE CCS
**Developed by:** SAE International (industry consortium)
**Standard years:** 2012-2025 (being phased out)

**What it looks like:**
Larger connector that combines J1772 (AC charging) plug with two additional DC pins below.

**Key Specs:**
- **Power Range:** Up to 350 kW
- **Voltage:** AC via J1772 portion, DC via combo pins
- **Networks:** Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint, IONNA

**Who uses it:**
- **Most 2023-2025 EVs** (except Tesla and Rivian)
- Ford, GM, Hyundai, Kia, VW, Nissan Ariya, etc.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Widespread public infrastructure (for now)
- ✅ High power capability (350 kW)
- ✅ Backward compatible with J1772 Level 2 chargers

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Bulky and heavy (especially in cold weather)
- ❌ Two-piece design (more failure points)
- ❌ Being phased out (less future investment)

## The Great Connector Transition (2024-2027)

### Why Everyone's Switching to NACS

1. **Supercharger Network Dominance**
   Tesla has 50,000+ Supercharger connectors in North America—more than all other DC fast charging networks combined. Access to this network is game-changing for road trips.

2. **Superior Design**
   NACS is objectively smaller, lighter, and more reliable than CCS1. Even competing automakers admit it's a better connector.

3. **Industry Momentum**
   When Ford announced adoption in May 2023, followed by GM, Rivian, and eventually everyone else, NACS became inevitable.

## Adapter Guide: Accessing Different Networks

### If You Have CCS1 (most 2024-2025 EVs)

**To charge at Tesla Superchargers:**
- Get a NACS adapter from your manufacturer
- Ford/GM: Free via app
- Others: ~$150-$250 purchase
- Download Tesla app (required for non-Tesla charging)

**To charge at public CCS1 stations:**
- No adapter needed (use your vehicle's native port)

### If You Have NACS (Tesla, 2026+ models)

**To charge at Tesla Superchargers:**
- No adapter needed (plug and charge)

**To charge at CCS1 stations:**
- Tesla CCS Combo 1 Adapter ($250 from Tesla)
- Allows access to Electrify America, EVgo, etc.

**To charge at Level 2 (J1772) stations:**
- J1772 adapter (included with all Teslas)

## Real-World Charging Strategy

### For CCS1 EV Owners (2024-2025 models)

**Daily charging:**
- Home: Level 2 charger (install 240V EVSE)
- Public: Level 2 at work, shopping centers (J1772 built into CCS1)

**Road trips:**
- Primary: Tesla Supercharger (with NACS adapter)
- Backup: Electrify America, EVgo (native CCS1)

**Pro tip:** Once you get your NACS adapter, Superchargers become your go-to for road trips. More reliable, better locations, faster charging.

### For NACS EV Owners (Tesla, 2026+ models)

**Daily charging:**
- Home: Level 2 charger
- Public: Level 2 with J1772 adapter (comes with vehicle)

**Road trips:**
- Primary: Tesla Supercharger (native)
- Backup: Purchase CCS adapter for access to Electrify America if needed

**Pro tip:** You're in the best position. Native Supercharger access is the gold standard for road trip charging.

## Common Questions

### "Should I wait for a 2026 model with native NACS?"

**If you need an EV now:** Buy 2024-2025 with CCS1 and get the free/cheap NACS adapter. The adapter works fine and you'll have access to everything.

**If you can wait:** 2026 models with native NACS will be slightly more convenient (no adapter to carry), but it's not a huge difference.

**Bottom line:** Don't let connector anxiety stop you from buying an EV you want. Adapters solve the problem.

### "Will CCS1 chargers disappear?"

**No, not anytime soon.** While new installations will favor NACS, existing CCS1 chargers will remain operational for many years. Think of it like USB-C vs USB-A—both coexist for a long transition period.

### "Do I need to buy multiple adapters?"

**Most people need:**
- NACS adapter (if you have CCS1) - for Superchargers
- J1772 adapter (if you have NACS) - usually included with vehicle

That's it. You don't need a collection of adapters.

### "Can adapters handle full charging speed?"

**Yes.** Properly designed adapters (from manufacturers or Tesla) support the full power output of both the vehicle and charger. A Ford with NACS adapter can charge at 150 kW on a 250 kW Supercharger, for example.

### "What about CHAdeMO?"

**CHAdeMO is dead** (in North America). It was used by Nissan Leaf (2010-2024), which has been discontinued. If you have a CHAdeMO vehicle, you're stuck with limited and shrinking infrastructure. CHAdeMO-to-CCS or CHAdeMO-to-NACS adapters exist but are expensive and rare.

## The Future: Post-2027

By 2027-2028, expect:
- Nearly all new EVs sold with native NACS
- Continued operation of existing CCS1 chargers
- New charging station installations primarily NACS
- Possible dual-cable stations (NACS + CCS1) at some locations
- IONNA network (joint venture of BMW, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes, Stellantis) to use NACS

**The transition is well underway, and NACS has won.** This is good for consumers—one standard, better access, more competition.
