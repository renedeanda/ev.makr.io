## Battery Preconditioning: The 2026 Game-Changer

One of the biggest upgrades in the 2026 Solterra is **automatic battery preconditioning**.

### What is Battery Preconditioning?

Your Solterra's battery performs best at 68-77°F. In cold weather (&lt;40°F), the battery management system heats the battery to optimal temperature **before** you arrive at a DC fast charger.

### How It Works

**Automatic Preconditioning:**
1. Enter DC fast charger as destination in navigation
2. Solterra automatically starts warming battery 15-20 minutes before arrival
3. Battery reaches optimal temperature as you arrive
4. Charging speed: **140-150 kW** instead of 40-60 kW

**Manual Preconditioning:**
1. Settings → EV → Battery Preconditioning → **On**
2. Use when you know you'll charge soon
3. Takes 15-30 minutes depending on outside temp

### Impact on Charging Speed

| Outside Temp | Without Preconditioning | **With Preconditioning** |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **70°F+** | 150 kW | 150 kW (same) |
| **40-70°F** | 120-140 kW | 145-150 kW |
| **20-40°F** | 60-90 kW | **130-145 kW** |
| **&lt;20°F** | 40-60 kW | **100-130 kW** |

**What This Means:**
- 10-80% charge in winter: **25-30 minutes** (with preconditioning) vs 45-60 minutes (without)
- **Always use navigation to DC chargers** to trigger automatic preconditioning
