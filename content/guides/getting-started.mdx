# Getting Started with Your First EV

Welcome to the world of electric vehicles! Whether you just took delivery of your first EV or you're planning to make the switch, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with confidence.

## Your First Week: The Essentials

### Day 1: Understanding Your Vehicle

Before you drive off the lot (or after the delivery truck leaves), take time to:

1. **Locate the charging port** - It sounds obvious, but knowing where it is and how to open it is crucial
2. **Find the charging cable** - Most EVs come with a Level 1 (120V) charging cable
3. **Download your manufacturer's app** - You'll use this for remote monitoring, charging scheduling, and more
4. **Read the quick start guide** - At minimum, understand how to charge, how to check range, and basic controls

### Day 2-3: Download Essential Apps

The EV ecosystem requires a few key apps. Here's what you need immediately:

#### **Must Have:**
- **Your manufacturer's app** (MySubaru, Tesla, Kia Access, etc.) - For vehicle control and monitoring
- **PlugShare** - To find any charging station anywhere
- **Your primary charging network app** - Likely Tesla or Electrify America depending on your vehicle

#### **Highly Recommended:**
- **A Better Route Planner (ABRP)** - Essential for road trip planning
- **Your utility company's app** - To monitor home charging costs and access special EV rates

### Understanding Charging Basics

#### The 80% Rule

One of the first things you'll hear about is the "80% rule":

**For daily charging: Charge to 80%, not 100%**

Why? Lithium-ion batteries last longer when you avoid keeping them at 100% charge regularly. Think of it like your phone battery—keeping it between 20-80% extends its lifespan.

**When to charge to 100%:**
- Before a long road trip
- About once per month for battery conditioning (check your owner's manual)

#### Charging Levels Explained

**Level 1 (120V - Regular Outlet)**
- **Speed:** 3-5 miles of range per hour
- **Use case:** Emergency charging, overnight for plug-in hybrids
- **Cost:** Free (comes with your vehicle)

**Level 2 (240V - Like a Dryer Outlet)**
- **Speed:** 25-40 miles of range per hour
- **Use case:** Primary home charging
- **Cost:** $500-$2,000 for equipment + installation

**Level 3 (DC Fast Charging)**
- **Speed:** 100-300+ miles in 30 minutes
- **Use case:** Road trips, quick charging away from home
- **Cost:** $0.25-$0.60 per kWh at public stations

### Your First Charge at Home

Most new EV owners can start with the included Level 1 charger:

1. Plug the charger into a standard 120V outlet
2. Plug the other end into your vehicle
3. The vehicle will indicate charging has started (usually a light or app notification)
4. Set a charge limit (80% for daily use) in your vehicle settings or app

**Important:** Make sure the outlet is on a dedicated circuit and not shared with other high-power devices.

### Understanding Range

**The golden rule: Real-world range ≠ EPA range**

Expect about 80-90% of the EPA-rated range in normal conditions. Range is affected by:

- **Temperature:** Cold weather can reduce range by 20-40%
- **Speed:** Highway driving uses more energy than city driving (opposite of gas cars!)
- **Climate control:** Heating uses significant energy (more than AC)
- **Driving style:** Aggressive acceleration reduces range

**Pro tip:** Use your EV's range estimator (not just the EPA number) and plan conservatively for your first few trips.

### Planning Your First Road Trip

Don't be intimidated by road trips! Here's the process:

1. **Open A Better Route Planner**
2. **Select your exact vehicle model** - This is crucial for accurate planning
3. **Enter your destination**
4. **Review the suggested charging stops** - ABRP will tell you where to stop and for how long
5. **Check PlugShare reviews** for each stop to verify stations are working
6. **Add 10-15 minutes buffer** to each charging stop for your first trip

## Common First-Week Questions

### "Should I install a home charger right away?"

**It depends on:**
- **Daily driving:** If you drive less than 40 miles/day, Level 1 might be sufficient
- **Access to workplace charging:** If you can charge at work, Level 1 at home may be fine
- **Budget:** Level 2 installation costs $500-$2,500 depending on your electrical panel

**Most owners install Level 2 within the first month** because the convenience is worth it.

### "Can I charge in the rain?"

**Yes, absolutely!** EV charging connectors are designed to be weatherproof. The connection is safe even in heavy rain or snow.

### "What if I run out of charge?"

1. **Your vehicle will warn you well in advance** - Multiple warnings before you actually run out
2. **Most manufacturers offer roadside assistance** - They'll tow you to the nearest charger
3. **Some services offer mobile charging** - They come to you with a portable charger

**Reality check:** Running out of charge is extremely rare. Your vehicle's range estimator is conservative, and you'll get many warnings.

### "How often do I need to 'fill up'?"

Unlike gas cars, you'll rarely let your EV get below 20%. Instead:

- **Plug in every night at home** (if you have home charging)
- **Top off at public chargers** during errands if needed
- **Only "fill up" (to 80-100%)** before road trips

Think of it like charging your phone—you don't wait until it's dead, you just plug it in regularly.

## Your First Week Checklist

- [ ] Charge your vehicle to 80% using the included Level 1 charger
- [ ] Download your manufacturer's app and PlugShare
- [ ] Set up charging schedule (if your vehicle/charger supports it)
- [ ] Learn to use regenerative braking / one-pedal driving
- [ ] Find the 3 closest DC fast charging stations using PlugShare
- [ ] Check if your utility offers special EV electricity rates
- [ ] Get quotes for Level 2 home charger installation (if desired)
- [ ] Plan a short 50-mile trip to build confidence with range
- [ ] Join your vehicle's online community (Reddit, Facebook groups, etc.)
- [ ] Read the charging section of your owner's manual

## What's Next?

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Optimize your charging costs** - Learn about time-of-use rates
2. **Master one-pedal driving** - It's more efficient and fun
3. **Plan your first road trip** - Use ABRP to build confidence
4. **Learn about battery care** - Understand degradation and how to minimize it
5. **Explore advanced features** - Preconditioning, scheduled charging, etc.
