# Home Charging Installation: Complete Guide

Installing a home charger is one of the best investments you'll make as an EV owner. This guide walks you through everything: costs, electrical requirements, choosing equipment, and finding installers.

⚠️ **SAFETY FIRST:** Home charging installation involves high-voltage electrical work. Always hire a licensed electrician and consult your vehicle's owner's manual for specific requirements. Improper installation can result in fire, electric shock, or damage to your vehicle.

---

## Why Install a Home Charger?

**The reality:** Most EV charging happens at home (80%+ of all charging). A Level 2 home charger transforms your EV ownership experience from "planning around public chargers" to "wake up with a full battery every morning."

**Benefits:**
- **Convenience:** Plug in at night, wake up fully charged
- **Cost:** Home electricity is 2-4x cheaper than public DC fast charging
- **Time:** Overnight charging while you sleep
- **Battery health:** Slower Level 2 charging is gentler on the battery than repeated DC fast charging

---

## Can I Just Use a Regular Outlet?

**Yes, but…** your EV comes with a Level 1 charging cable that plugs into a standard 120V outlet.

**The problem:**
- Level 1 charges at 3-5 miles of range per hour
- To fully charge a 60 kWh battery: **40-50 hours**
- For daily driving (40 miles): 8-12 hours overnight works
- For longer commutes or road trip prep: Painfully slow

**When Level 1 is sufficient:**
- Very short daily commute (<30 miles)
- Access to workplace charging
- Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) with small battery

**For most BEV owners:** Level 2 installation is essential.

---

## Level 2 Home Charging Explained

**What it is:** 240-volt charging (same as your electric dryer/oven)

**Charging speed:** 25-40 miles of range per hour (depending on charger power and vehicle)

**Full charge time:** 4-10 hours for most EVs

**Example:**
- 2026 Subaru Solterra (72.8 kWh battery)
- With 7.2 kW charger (30A circuit)
- 0-100% charge: ~10 hours
- Perfect for overnight charging

## Electrical Requirements

### Understanding Your Electrical Panel

**Typical home service:**
- 100 Amp (older homes)
- 150 Amp (common)
- 200 Amp (newer/larger homes)

**Load calculation:**
Each circuit in your panel draws a certain amount. Adding a 40-amp or 50-amp EV charger circuit requires available capacity.

**When you need a panel upgrade:**
- Total home load + EV charger exceeds panel capacity
- No physical space for additional breaker
- Panel is outdated/unsafe

**Cost of panel upgrade:** $1,500-$4,000

### Circuit Sizing

**Common charger power levels:**

| Charger Power | Circuit Size | Breaker | Typical Range/Hour |
|---------------|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| 3.8 kW | 20A / 240V | 20A | 12-15 mi/hr |
| 7.7 kW | 40A / 240V | 40A | 25-30 mi/hr |
| 9.6 kW | 50A / 240V | 50A | 30-37 mi/hr |
| 11.5 kW | 60A / 240V | 60A | 35-44 mi/hr |

**Most popular:** 40A circuit (7.7 kW charger)
- Works for 95% of EV owners
- Charges typical EV (60-80 kWh) overnight
- Doesn't overload most panels

**Pro tip:** Match charger to your vehicle's max AC charging rate
- 2026 Subaru Solterra: 6.6 kW max → 32A circuit sufficient
- Tesla Model 3/Y: 11 kW max → 48-60A circuit ideal
