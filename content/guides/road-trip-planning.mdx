# EV Road Trip Planning: Routes, Charging & Apps

**Road tripping in an EV is different from gas cars - but not harder.** With proper planning and the right apps, you'll enjoy quiet, smooth rides with lower fuel costs. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about planning successful long-distance EV trips.

---

## Why EV Road Trips Are Great

Before we dive into planning, here's why many EV owners prefer road tripping in their electric vehicles:

- **Lower fuel costs**: Charging typically costs 50-70% less than gas
- **Quiet, smooth ride**: No engine noise or vibration on long stretches
- **Forced breaks**: 20-30 minute charging stops are healthier than driving 5+ hours straight
- **Supercharger perks**: Many Tesla Supercharger locations have lounges, WiFi, and amenities
- **Autopilot/adaptive cruise**: Modern EVs have excellent driver assistance for highway driving

**The key difference**: Instead of 5-minute gas stops, plan for 20-40 minute charging breaks every 2-3 hours.

## Essential Apps for Trip Planning

### A Better Route Planner (ABRP)

**Best for**: Comprehensive trip planning across all EV brands

**What it does**:
- Calculates optimal charging stops based on your vehicle, battery level, and weather
- Shows real-time charger availability
- Adjusts route for elevation, wind, temperature
- Sends route directly to your car's navigation (Tesla, Polestar, others)

**How to use**:
1. Select your exact vehicle model and year
2. Enter your starting battery % and desired arrival battery %
3. Input departure and destination
4. Review suggested charging stops and adjust as needed
5. Save route or send to car

**Pro tip**: Set your arrival battery to 20-30% for safety margin, not 0%.

### PlugShare

**Best for**: Finding charging stations and reading reviews

**What it does**:
- Crowdsourced charger locations and reviews
- Filter by connector type (NACS, CCS1, Level 2)
- See real-time availability for some networks
- Check-in feature shows if chargers are working
- Photos of charger locations (helpful for finding hidden chargers)

**Pro tip**: Always read recent reviews (last 30 days) to verify chargers are operational.

### Tesla Supercharger App (Non-Tesla EVs)

**Best for**: NACS-equipped vehicles accessing Tesla Superchargers

**What it does**:
- Shows Tesla Supercharger locations open to all EVs
- Real-time stall availability
- Pricing per kWh at each location
- Navigation integration

**Who can use it**: 2024+ Ford, Rivian, GM vehicles with NACS, or any EV with NACS adapter.

### ChargePoint / Electrify America / EVgo Apps

**Best for**: Finding and managing charging sessions on specific networks

**What each offers**:
- **ChargePoint**: Largest network (mostly Level 2, some DC fast)
- **Electrify America**: Fast DC charging along highways (free for some VW/Audi/Porsche owners)

## Step-by-Step: Planning Your First Road Trip

### Step 1: Know Your Vehicle's Real-World Range

**Don't rely on EPA range.** Real-world highway range is typically 70-85% of EPA:

| EPA Range | Highway Range (70 mph) | Highway Range (80 mph) |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **300 mi** | 210-255 mi | 195-225 mi |
| **350 mi** | 245-298 mi | 228-263 mi |
| **400 mi** | 280-340 mi | 260-300 mi |

**Factors that reduce range**:
- High speeds (80 mph vs 65 mph = 15-20% less range)
- Cold weather (below 32°F = 20-35% less range)
- Headwinds and elevation gain
- Roof racks and cargo
- Running heat or A/C at max

**Pro tip**: Plan charging stops every 150-200 miles, not at your maximum range.

### Step 2: Use ABRP to Plan Your Route

**Example: Los Angeles to San Francisco (383 miles)**

1. Open ABRP, select your vehicle (e.g., "2025 Tesla Model 3 Long Range")
2. Enter departure: Los Angeles, CA
3. Enter destination: San Francisco, CA
4. Set starting battery: 90%
5. Set arrival battery: 20% (safety margin)
6. Review suggested route:

**ABRP suggests**:
- Depart LA with 90% battery (270 mi range)
- Stop 1: Kettleman City Supercharger (191 mi, charge 20 min)
- Arrive San Francisco with 22% battery

**Total trip time**: 6h 15min (5h 40min driving + 35min charging)

### Step 3: Add Buffer Time and Backup Chargers

**Never rely on a single charger.** Always identify backup options:

**Original plan**:
- Kettleman City Supercharger (primary)

**Backup plan**:
- Coalinga Supercharger (15 mi before Kettleman - backup if Kettleman is full)
- Lost Hills Supercharger (35 mi before Kettleman - backup if both are down)

**Pro tip**: Screenshot your charging stops and save offline maps in case you lose cell service.

### Step 4: Check Real-Time Availability Before Each Stop

**15-20 miles before your planned charging stop**:

1. Check PlugShare for recent check-ins (last 24 hours)
2. Check ABRP for real-time stall availability
3. Read recent reviews for any issues
4. If chargers look busy or broken, reroute to backup

**Red flags**:
- Multiple "broken" reports in last 7 days
- "All stalls occupied" during your arrival time
- Recent reviews mentioning slow charging speeds

## Charging Strategy for Long Trips

### The 20-80% Rule

**Fastest road trip charging**:
- Arrive at charger with 10-20% battery
- Charge to 70-80%, then leave
- Charging from 80-100% is 3-4x slower

**Why this works**:

| Battery Level | Charge Speed | Time to Add |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **10-50%** | 150-250 kW | 15-20 min (+40%) |
| **50-80%** | 100-150 kW | 10-15 min (+30%) |
| **80-100%** | 30-75 kW | 30-45 min (+20%) |

**Example**: Adding 70% battery (10% → 80%) takes ~30 minutes. Adding the last 20% (80% → 100%) takes another 30+ minutes.

**Pro tip**: It's faster to charge to 80%, drive 2 hours, and charge again to 80% than to charge to 100% once.

### Maximize Charging Speed

**Before you plug in**:
1. **Precondition your battery** (if available): Start 20-30 min before arrival
   - Tesla: Navigate to Supercharger (auto-preconditions)
   - Ford: "Prepare for DC Fast Charge" in settings
   - Hyundai/Kia: Navigate to charger in built-in nav
   - Rivian: Navigate to charger in Rivian nav

2. **Choose the right stall**:
   - **Tesla**: Use isolated stalls (e.g., 1A, not 1A/1B pairs) for full power
   - **Electrify America**: 350 kW chargers are faster than 150 kW chargers
   - **EVgo**: Avoid chargers showing "In Use" on paired stalls

3. **Park correctly**: Back in if charge port is rear, pull in if front/side

**While charging**:
- Don't run climate at max (reduces charge speed)
- Stay in the car or nearby (some networks pause if car is locked/sleeping)
- Monitor charge speed in your app

**When to leave**:
- As soon as you hit your target % (usually 70-80%)
- If charge speed drops below 50 kW and you're above 70%

## Common Road Trip Scenarios

### Scenario 1: City-to-City Highway Trip (300-500 miles)

**Example**: Seattle to Portland (173 mi)

**Strategy**:
- Depart with 80-90% battery
- No charging needed (well within range)
- Arrive with 40-50% battery
- Charge overnight at destination

**Pro tip**: For trips under 250 miles, you often don't need to charge en route.

### Scenario 2: Long Highway Trip (500-1000 miles)

**Example**: San Diego to Portland (1,087 mi)

**Strategy**:
- Plan 3-4 charging stops every 150-200 miles
- Target 20-30 minute charging sessions
- Use rest stops to eat, stretch, use restroom
- Break trip into day 1 (550 mi) and day 2 (537 mi)

**Pro tip**: Align charging stops with meal breaks to maximize efficiency.

### Scenario 3: Rural/Remote Driving

**Example**: Denver to Yellowstone (563 mi through rural Wyoming)

**Strategy**:
- Identify DC fast chargers along route (fewer options)
- Have multiple backup chargers planned
- Consider Level 2 overnight charging at hotels
- Depart with 100% battery for rural segments
- Drive conservatively (65 mph instead of 80 mph)

**Pro tip**: Download offline maps and screenshot charger locations. Cell service is spotty in rural areas.

### Scenario 4: Mountain Driving

**Example**: Los Angeles to Mammoth Lakes (315 mi with 7,000 ft elevation gain)

**Strategy**:
- Expect 30-40% range loss going uphill
- Plan charging stop before major elevation climbs
- Enjoy regenerative braking on downhills (you'll recover 10-20% battery)
- Consider charging at destination instead of en route

**Pro tip**: ABRP accounts for elevation. Always use it for mountain trips.

## What to Do When Things Go Wrong

### Charger Is Broken/Full

**Immediate actions**:
1. Check other stalls at the same location (often only 1-2 are broken)
2. Wait 5-10 minutes if chargers are full (EVs charge fast, turnover is quick)
3. Reroute to backup charger (this is why you identified backups!)

**If you're low on battery**:
- Slow down to 60-65 mph (extends range by 10-15%)
- Turn off climate (extends range by 5-10%)
- Use cruise control (smoother = more efficient)
- Look for Level 2 chargers as emergency option (hotels, malls, RV parks)

### Charging Slower Than Expected

**Possible causes**:
1. **Battery too cold**: Let car warm up for 5-10 min before charging
2. **Battery too hot**: Charge speed limited by battery thermal management
3. **Charger issue**: Try different stall or network
4. **Battery above 80%**: This is normal - charging slows significantly above 80%
5. **Shared power**: On some chargers, two cars on same pair split power

**Solutions**:
- If below 50% and charging less than 50 kW, switch stalls
- If above 80%, just accept slower speeds or leave
- Precondition battery next time

### Lost/No Cell Service

**Preparation is key**:
1. Download offline maps in Google Maps before trip
2. Screenshot charging stop locations and addresses
3. Save ChargePoint, EA, EVgo cards in Apple/Google Wallet for offline access
4. Print out route and charging stops (old school but works!)

## Pro Tips from Experienced EV Road Trippers

1. **Align charging with meals**: Stop for lunch at a charging location. By the time you finish eating, your car is charged.

2. **Drive during off-peak times**: Fewer people at chargers (avoid Friday afternoons/Sunday evenings).

3. **Plan bathroom breaks at charging stops**: You need to stop anyway - combine activities.

4. **Bring entertainment for kids**: 20-30 minute charging breaks = perfect time for snacks, games, stretching.

5. **Join EV forums for route-specific advice**: Tesla Motors Club, Rivian Forums, MachE Forum have trip reports for every route.

6. **Don't stress about exact percentages**: ABRP builds in buffer. If it says arrive with 15%, you'll probably have 20%.

7. **Embrace the journey**: Forced breaks make for healthier, more relaxed road trips.
