# Essential EV Apps: What You Actually Need

One of the biggest surprises for new EV owners is the **app overload**. Unlike gas cars where you just pull up to any station, the EV charging ecosystem requires multiple apps for different networks, finding stations, and planning trips.

This guide cuts through the confusion and tells you **exactly which apps to download**, **when you need them**, and **which ones you can skip**.

---

## The "Must Install Immediately" Tier

These three apps should be on your phone before you even leave the dealership:

### 1. PlugShare (Finding Charging Stations)

**Platform:** iOS, Android, Web
**Cost:** Free (optional Premium for $2/month)
**Why you need it:** Most comprehensive, community-driven charging station database

**What it does:**
- Find ANY charging station (Tesla, Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint, random Level 2 chargers)
- Real-time status updates from actual users
- User reviews and photos (critical for knowing if chargers actually work)
- Filter by connector type (NACS, CCS1, CHAdeMO)
- Filter by charging speed (Level 2, DC Fast)
- Trip planning with charging stops

**How to use it:**

1. **Download the app** and create an account
2. **Set your vehicle type** (this filters to compatible chargers)
3. **Check the map** before heading to any public charger
4. **Read recent reviews** (crucial—users report broken chargers within hours)
5. **"Check in"** when you arrive to help other drivers

**Pro tips:**
- Before trusting a charger, check reviews from **the last 7 days**
- Green pins = recently confirmed working
- Gray pins = no recent activity (could be offline)
- If a charger shows "2 of 4 stalls working," believe it
- Use photos to locate chargers in complex parking lots

**Premium features ($2/month):**
- Advanced trip planning
- Offline maps
- Additional filters
- Worth it? **Maybe.** The free version is excellent; upgrade only if you road trip frequently.

**Download:**
- iOS: Search "PlugShare" in App Store
- Android: Search "PlugShare" in Google Play
- Web: [plugshare.com](https://www.plugshare.com)

### 2. Your Vehicle Manufacturer App

Every EV has an official app. Download it immediately.

**Common Apps by Brand:**
- **Tesla:** Tesla app
- **Ford:** FordPass
- **GM:** myChevrolet, myCadillac, myGMC
- **Hyundai:** Hyundai Bluelink
- **Kia:** Kia Access
- **Nissan:** MyNISSAN
- **Subaru:** MySubaru
- **Rivian:** Rivian app
- **VW:** myVW

### 3. A Better Route Planner (ABRP) - For Road Trips

**Platform:** iOS, Android, Web
**Cost:** Free (Premium $5/month adds live traffic and weather)
**Why you need it:** Best tool for planning EV road trips

**What it does:**
- Calculates optimal charging stops based on YOUR specific vehicle
- Accounts for elevation, weather, temperature, driving style
- Tells you exactly how long to charge at each stop
- Suggests "charge to X%" at each location
- Reroutes in real-time if you're using more/less energy than expected
- Integrates with in-car navigation (Tesla, Polestar)

**How to use it:**

**Before your first road trip:**
1. Download app and select your **exact vehicle model** (e.g., "2026 Subaru Solterra Touring XT")
2. Enter starting point and destination
3. Set preferences:
   - **Charging networks** (prefer Supercharger, avoid broken EVgo, etc.)
   - **Arrival battery %** (arrive with 10-20% for safety)
   - **Speed** (faster route vs. fewer stops)
4. ABRP suggests optimal stops

**Example output:**
```
Stop 1: Tesla Supercharger, Bakersfield
- Charge: 22 min (20% → 75%)
- Cost: ~$18

Stop 2: Electrify America, Barstow
- Charge: 18 min (32% → 80%)
- Cost: ~$15

Arrive with 15% battery
```

**During your trip:**
- Follow the plan, but don't stress if you deviate
- ABRP adjusts in real-time based on your actual energy use
- If charging slower than expected, ABRP extends the stop time

**Pro tips:**
- Add 5-10 minutes to recommended charge times (bathroom breaks, food)
- Don't charge to 100% at DC fast chargers (slows dramatically after 80%)
- Premium version ($5/month) adds live traffic/weather—worth it for frequent road trips

**Download:**
- iOS: Search "A Better Route Planner"
- Android: Search "ABRP"

## The Apps I Actually Use (Personal Experience)

As the owner of a 2026 Subaru Solterra, here's my honest assessment:

**Daily:**
- MySubaru app (check charge level, set climate)

**Weekly:**
- PlugShare (checking chargers before road trips or unfamiliar areas)

**Monthly:**
- Tesla app (when using Superchargers with NACS adapter)
- ABRP (planning road trips)

**Rarely:**
- Electrify America (backup when Superchargers are full or inconvenient)
- ChargePoint (occasionally at hotels/shopping centers)

**Never Use:**
- EVgo (not common in my area)
- Chargeway (redundant)

**Deleted:**
- 3 other network apps I downloaded but never needed

---

## Common Questions

### "Do I need an app to charge at public chargers?"

**Level 2 (destination charging):** Usually optional. Most accept credit cards or are free.

**DC Fast Charging:** App makes it easier, but most stations accept credit cards at the charger.

**Tesla Supercharger (for non-Tesla):** App is **required**.

---

### "Can I delete network apps I'm not using?"

**Yes!** If you downloaded EVgo but never use it, delete it. You can always reinstall later.

---

### "Which app for finding chargers: PlugShare or Google Maps?"

**PlugShare, hands down.** Google Maps shows charger locations but lacks:
- Real-time status (working/broken)
- User reviews
- Recent check-ins
- Detailed charger info

PlugShare has all of this and is updated by actual EV drivers in real-time.

---

### "Is ABRP necessary for short trips?"

**No.** For trips within your vehicle's range, just use your car's built-in navigation. ABRP shines on multi-stop road trips requiring charging.

---

### "Do Tesla owners need as many apps?"

**No.** Tesla owners have it easiest:
- Tesla app (does everything—climate, charging, navigation, Supercharger access)
- Maybe PlugShare (to find non-Tesla chargers as backup)
- Optional: CCS adapter + network apps for non-Supercharger access

That's it. The Tesla ecosystem is the most integrated.

## The Bottom Line

**You don't need 15 apps.** Start with **PlugShare, your vehicle app, and ABRP**. Add network apps only when you actually encounter those chargers.

The app ecosystem feels overwhelming at first, but within a month you'll settle into using 3-5 apps regularly. Delete the rest.

**Pro tip:** Create a phone folder called "EV Charging" and keep all these apps together. Makes them easier to find when you need them.
